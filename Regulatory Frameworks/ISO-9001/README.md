ISO 9001 is an international quality management system (QMS) standard which provides a foundation for planning, control, and improvement at nearly any enterprise or organization.

## How can an organization satisfy the requirements of ISO 9001?

A requirement can be satisfied in a number of ways, including but not limited to: communicating a requirement, developing a process, documenting a procudure, keeping a record, training personnel, inspecting a product, or other controls (Cochran 2).

## Where did ISO 9001 originate from?

The first publication was in 1987 and was based on U.S. military / government contracting standards used since WWII. This framework was heavily focused on documentation and largely oriented to manufacturing.

## What is unique about ISO 9001:2015

ISO 9001:2015 shifts to a risk-based model, emphasizes change management, expands the role
of top management, and reinforces the concept of process management (Cochran 4).
