## Model of how each repo / compliance framework should be set up

### Tech needs

* Code that can draw the process AND model the underlying data structure
* Only the current process should be visible but the process are integrated
in the DB
* How to synchronize edits between GUI (visual of the process) and the process
code?

#### Tech to explore

- Mermaid project on github (way to draw diagrams from code)
- Neo4j graph database
- Prologram neo4j browser

#### Tree of repo structure 

Company
> Repo: ISO 9001
>> READ-ME: Explain in plain english what this is and why it's important and what it covers
>>> Branch: subset of ISO 9001 / specific set of requirements
>>> Branch Owner
//repeat below as needed
>>>> requirement
>>>> control / evidence
>>>> test plan (with evidence storage plan and owner)
//control and test plan are written in process code that generates a visual (Mermaid github?)
>>>> unit test pass Y/N
