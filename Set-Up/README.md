## Initial set-up

* Organizations first complete an questionnaire designed to identify their compliance needs. The result of the questionnaire is a list of suggested "modules" which each correspond to a regulatory framework and contain:
  * Expert guidance and analysis
  * Pre-built controls, unit tests, and queries, to assess current compliance / control status ()
  * Operational templates which can be adapted for the organization and used to design compliant operations
* Organizations import their current operations and processes into Playbook and then use the tools contained in the module to understand if they are currently compliant and if not, how they must adapt to reach compliance.
  * This import can be accomplished manually via the Playbook interface, starting from a pre-built template, or through structured import of existing process docs (Visio, Excel, etc.)
  * The initial configuration is typically done by operational resources within the organization (such as the PMO or Internal Audit) or in conjunction with Playbook partners
  * Additional details can be imported automatically from the organization's directory or existing IT infrastructure
