#Playbook Ontology

The Playbook Ontology is a framework to describe business processes and operations.
It draws from industry-standard conventions and best practices such as UML,
PMBOK, and others while remaining flexible to accommodate user-defined variance.

##Objects, Properties, and Relationships

The Playbook Ontology is composed of *Objects* with *Properties* and *Relationships*
between Objects.
