# Playbook Ontology

The Playbook Ontology is a framework to describe business processes and operations.
It draws from industry-standard conventions and best practices such as UML,
PMBOK, and others while remaining flexible to accommodate user-defined variance.

## Objects, Properties, and Relationships

The Playbook Ontology is composed of **Objects** with **Properties** and the **Relationships**
between Objects.

### Objects

There are 3 object types: *People*, *Process*, and *Technology*.

* People are the individuals within your organization who perform a function related to process
or technology. There are multiple possible roles that a people can play (see "Relationships")
* Process refers to the actions in a workflow
* Technology encompasses the systems and tools used to execute the workflow. This
definition extends to non-technical systems such as meetings or phone calls

###Properties
