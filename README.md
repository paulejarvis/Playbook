# Playbook

## What is the problem?

Organizations lack a single source of truth for business processes. Executives, managers, and end users within the organization, as well as auditors, advisors, consultants, and others outside of the organization, do not have a shared view of how the organization operates.

## Why is this important now?

Businesses are getting more complex, competition is increasing, and the global regulatory landscape is becoming more complicated. Organizations that aspire to be competitive require a unified operating manual, or Playbook, that provides a unified view of all business processes to be able to operate as effectively as safely possible, optimally use resources, comply with applicable laws and regulations, and reduce unnecessary cost and delays.

## Why hasn't this been solved before?

Existing tools are designed to create flowcharts and visual representations of processes - this is an oversimplification of the complexity of modern regulated processes. Process documentation, if it exists, is distributed across the organization and stored in various formats and locations (flowcharts, checklists, wikis, SharePoint, etc). The lack of a universal format or interface results in disconnected and siloed process documentation that does not capture how workstreams are interdependent and interconnected and overlooks the reality that outputs from one process may form the inputs to a second process or how resources may be shared across processes. This one-dimensional approach produces documentation that does not accurately capture current state (and is itself burdensome to produce) and does not help the organization achieve its goals of operating safely and legally, reducing cost and friction, and optimizing resource usage.

## What is Playbook?

Playbook is a platform for integrated business processes. Playbook *treats process like code* and uses a data model that represents business processes as People, Process, and Technology objects with relationships between these objects. The [Playbook Ontology](https://github.com/paulejarvis/Playbook/blob/master/Data%20Structure%20and%20Ontology/Playbook%20Ontology.md) describes the data model in further detail.

## Why is this valuable?

Playbook establishes a new standard and interface for organizations and their external partners to share a single, reliable view of how the organization operates. This is enables organizations to:

* Analyze operations across the entire organization, powering informed decisions on where to invest in resources and technology (i.e. cutting an IT system that is only used in one workflow or shifting hiring to an understaffed team)
* Adopt a platform and shared standard for reviewing operations with advisory firms and auditors, reducing the time and cost of achieving compliance
* Update processes iteratively with nuanced version control, eliminating the need for time-consuming and disruptive re-orgs
* Empower every employee to keep documentation up-to-date and actionable
* Optimize employee productivity as job requirements and workflow steps are clearly documented for all roles

## Who are the customers?

Playbook seeks to partner with major advisory and audit firms to implement Playbook's data model and interface as the standard in their client engagements. Clients would also have access to pre-built process templates (to implement new processes), queries (to understand current processes), and tests (to surface control gaps and risks).

### Disclaimer

While Playbook is developed in partnership with subject-matter experts, Playbook cannot guarantee that an organization will pass an audit or other review - that determination can only be made by the appropriate governing body.
