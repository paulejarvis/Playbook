* external consultants

How do they do it?
* templates available that we have reviewed and believe are compliant

# Playbook

## What is Playbook?

Playbook is a marketplace for expert guidance and pre-built operations templates and controls covering major compliance / regulatory frameworks.

## What is the Playbook Ontology?

Playbook models the people, processes, and technologies, powering the organization as objects in a graph database. Objects have properties and are connected to each other via relationships (which also have properties describing the relationship). The [Playbook Ontology](https://github.com/paulejarvis/Playbook/blob/master/Data%20Structure%20and%20Ontology/Playbook%20Ontology.md) describes the data model in further detail.











What is included in each module? - link to regulatory framework
* full text

link to sample queries as an example of the value

## What can an organization accomplish with Playbook?

* Integrate independent processes to understand the overlaps and relationships within the organization
* Manage the database (which collectively forms an "operational knowledge base") with branching, version control, and nuanced permissions (a Git-style workflow), allowing end-users and individual contributors within the organization
to suggest changes and submit them for review and approval
* Design "unit tests" to evaluate whether the operational design is compliant with
regulatory frameworks such as SOX, ISO-9001, DOL guidance, and more
* Query the database to deeply understand how the organization operates. Sample queries
may include:
  * What processes require review by the Board of Directors?
  * Which processes involve the CRM system?
  * Who is involved in the performance review process?
* Export the code to flowcharts to share with regulators, employees, and others interested in the
process design
