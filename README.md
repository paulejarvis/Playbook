# Playbook

## What is the problem?

There is no recognized standard for documenting business processes. As a result, business processes are documented inconsistently (if documented at all) and executives, managers, and end users within the organization, as well as auditors, advisors, consultants, and others outside of the organization, do not have a shared view of how the organization operates. This results in increased risk, inefficiency, and cost.

## Why is this important now?

Businesses are getting more complex, competition is increasing, and the global regulatory landscape is becoming more complicated. Organizations that aspire to be competitive require a unified operating manual, or Playbook, that provides a unified view of all business processes to be able to operate as effectively as safely possible, optimally use resources, comply with applicable laws and regulations, and reduce unnecessary cost and delays.

## Why hasn't this been solved before?

The current approach to process documentation is one-dimensional and does not capture how workstreams are interdependent and interconnected. Outputs from one process may form the inputs to a second process and resources are often shared across processes, yet process documentation treats each process as a siloed and independent operation.

Existing tools (such as Visio, Lucidchart, and draw.io) are designed to create flowcharts and visual representations of processes - this is an oversimplification of the complexity of modern regulated processes and does not capture the full business context.

As a result, process documentation is often viewed as a burden and inaccurate, and does not help the organization achieve its goals of operating safely and legally, reducing cost and friction, and optimizing resource usage.

## What is Playbook?

Playbook is a software platform for capturing and analyzing business processes that is built on a new standard for modeling processes, the [Playbook Ontology](https://github.com/paulejarvis/Playbook/blob/master/Data%20Structure%20and%20Ontology/Playbook%20Ontology.md). The Playbook Ontology breaks down processes into discrete components defined as People, Process, and Technology (with relationships between these objects).

The Playbook platform leverages this standard data model to allow organizations to capture, analyze, and review all business processes through a single interface.

## Why is this valuable?

Playbook enables organizations and their external partners to share a single, reliable view of how the organization operates. Organizations can then:

* Analyze operations across the entire organization, powering informed decisions on where to invest in resources and technology (i.e. cutting an IT system that is only used in one workflow or shifting hiring to an understaffed team)
* Adopt a platform and shared standard for reviewing operations with advisory firms and auditors, reducing the time and cost of achieving compliance
* Report on risks and controls gaps across the organization, ensuring that the Board is provided with accurate and timely information 
* Update processes iteratively with nuanced version control, eliminating the need for time-consuming and disruptive re-orgs
* Empower every employee to keep documentation up-to-date and actionable
* Optimize employee productivity as job requirements and workflow steps are clearly documented for all roles

## Who are the customers?

Playbook seeks to partner with major advisory and audit firms to implement Playbook's data model and interface as the standard in their client engagements.

#### Disclaimer

While Playbook is developed in partnership with subject-matter experts, Playbook cannot guarantee that an organization will pass an audit or other review - that determination can only be made by the appropriate governing body.
