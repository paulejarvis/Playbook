## What is Playbook

Playbook is the operational knowledge base for the modern enterprise. It represents the people, processes, and technology powering the organization as code, allowing users to iteratively update the knowledge base with branching, version control, and nuanced permissions, define unit tests and run these against the process code to assess compliance with regulatory frameworks, and query the knowledge base to fully understand how the organization operates.
