# Playbook

## What is Playbook?

Playbook is the operational knowledge base for the modern enterprise.

## How does Playbook work?

Playbook models the people, processes, and technology comprising the enterprise as data
and captures this in a graph database, allowing analysis of the people, processes, and technologies
and the relationships between them.

## What can an organization accomplish with Playbook?

* Integrate independent processes to understand the overlaps and relationships within the organization

* Manage the database (which collectively forms an "operational knowledge base") with branching, version control, and nuanced permissions (a Git-style workflow), allowing end-users and individual contributors within the organization
to suggest changes and submit them for review and approval
* Design "unit tests" to evaluate whether the operational design is compliant with
regulatory frameworks such as SOX, ISO-9001, DOL guidance, and more
* Query the database to deeply understand how the organization operates. Sample queries
may include:
  * What processes require review by the Board of Directors?
  * Which processes involve the CRM system?
  * Who is involved in the performance review process?
* Export the code to flowcharts to share with regulators, employees, and others interested in the
process design

## What else is included in Playbook?

* The text of key regulatory frameworks is stored along with guidance, unit tests, and
templates for designing compliant processes
