## Capturing some ideas for the UI

- Ask the user to add a "context" or workflow for the new process (hiring, Finance, etc)
  - This determines what will be pre-populated as suggestions
- Use an input (plus natural language processing) to allow the user to *explain*
what they want to do and have that be translated into process-code

### Example

- User sets the context as "Interviewing"
- User selects that they want to clone an existing workflow (a current hiring process)
for a new role
- User is guided through the process of creating each node by filling in the People, Process, and
Technology for each step - "who" is doing "what" "where / how"?
